<title>MY HOBBIES</title>
<h1>ROWING</h1>
<p>I started at Twin Cities Youth Rowing or TCYR last summer with my neighbor Chloe Rae. I was a novice with about 10 other boys<br>
, Chloe started as a novice as well with 6 other girls. At first we were on land in the boat house to get into practice with our<br>
strokes and speed. We also had to get into the habbit of doing stretches and weights at the boat house, but as time passed I learned<br>
that I preffered to be at the boat house. When we were on the water we were rowing up to 75 minutes at a time plus 3 kilometer<br>
runs before we even got on the water with our 4-8 person boats. Even though this sport is verry difficult I enjoyed it quite a lot<br>
and I plan to do it for the next 4 years or so almost every day and so does my neighbor.</p>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>I will read almost any fantasy book I can get my hands on depending on the content. I got my love of reading from my third grade teacher.<BR>
I believe I have currentley read 800 fantasy books and 150 other types of books.
