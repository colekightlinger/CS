  <p>This website is for my computer science class. I will be adding hobbies, projects and books to this website as per required.<br>
   The projects will be placed in at some point over the next few months. I will be progressively be adding books and their description<br>
   to the assigned page. On the hobbies page you will be finding some things that you might be urged to do, but that's unlikely<br>
   considering what I consider my hobbies. If you are reading this now you can expect to find this website being updated and upgraded<br>
  every few weeks.</p>
