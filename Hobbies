<Title>MY HOBBIES</Title>
<H1>ROWING</H1>
<P>I started at Twin Cities Youth Rowing or TCYR last summer with my neighbor Chloe Rae. I was a novice with about 10 other boys<BR>
, Chloe started as a novice as well with 6 other girls. At first we were on land in the boat house to get into practice with our<BR>
strokes and speed. We also had to get into the habbit of doing stretches and weights at the boat house, but as time passed I learned<BR>
that I preffered to be at the boat house. When we were on the water we were rowing up to 75 minutes at a time plus 3 kilometer<BR>
runs before we even got on the water with our 4-8 person boats. Even though this sport is verry difficult I enjoyed it quite a lot<BR>
and I plan to do it for the next 4 years or so almost every day and so does my neighbor.</P>
