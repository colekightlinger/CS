<h1>President success project</h1>
  <h2>data collection</h2>
  <p>The way we collected our data was from a site called Tuva labs. We basically looked at two different data sets, which<br>
  contained all of the data that we ended up needing for this project.</p>
  <h2>data analysis</h2>
  <p>We analysed the data by first organising it from the charts on tuva labs into our own charts from google sheets. We then<br>
  looked at the connections between the different attributes of the presidents and compared them if there was any sort of<br>
  connection.</p>
  
  <h2>conclusion</h2>
  <p>After analyzing connections between attributes  such as executive orders, avocation, party, and years served in office,<br>
  we determined that there is a connection between avocation and years served and between party and number of executive orders.<br>
  For example, Lawyers and public officials have an easier time getting elected and keeping office for eight years. Also,<br>
  Republicans have a lot more executive orders on average than all others.</p>
