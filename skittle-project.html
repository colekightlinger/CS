    <h1>What color of skittle has the most/least mass and density on average?</h1>
    
    <h2>Data collection</h2>
    <p>We began collecting our data by using a balance to find the individual mass of each Skittle. We then added the mass<br>
     of a set of 20 Skittles(all the same colors) and divided it by 20 to find the average mass of each skittle. We did that<br>
     particular mass test for each color of skittle(Yellow, Red, Green, Purple, Orange). We also put the same sets of 20 into<br>
     a graduated cylinder to find the total volume using water displacement, and then divided that number by 20 to find the<br>
      average volume of each skittle.  </p>
    
    <h2>Data analysis</h2>
    <p>After we measured the average volume and mass of the skittles, we then proceed to calculate the density of the skittles. <br> 
     What we found was that the color of the skittles had little to no impact on the density. <br> 
     The grape skittle had the highest density, about 5g/ml above the rest, which makes sense because in nature grapes are a dense fruit. <br> 
      Here is a bar graph of the densities of the skittles.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The purple skittles, or grape skittles have the most mass at 1.04 grams. The grape skittles also have the highest density<br>
     at 1.48571 g/mL. Yellow or lemon and green or lime are tied for lowest mass at 1.005 grams. Lime skittles have the lowest<br>
     density at 1.41055 g/mL.</p>
